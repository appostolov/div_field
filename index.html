<p id="author"><b>Description:</b> Tool for painting. The field is created from div elements, who inherit the selected color if the mouse move over it while the mouse button is pushed.<br /><br />
<b>From the creator:</b> I have created this simple tool to try my idea for a field from HTML elements. While the elements are sensitive to some events, we can manipulate them for the desired effects - painting, drawing, animation, games and etc.<br />But there is a problem - when you create HTML element you create object with attributes and methods. That's why if the objects are too many the browser crash. In other words if I make my elements 1px to 1px with this size of the field, I'll need 250000 elements with their attributes and methods. In other side, the application is very simple, the technologies are very basic and will work in old browsers (except the color input).</p>
